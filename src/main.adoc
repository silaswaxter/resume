//| Senior Design
//:project-duration: September 2024 - Current
include::template/project.adoc[]
* Made two buck converters, 30W and 50W, that steps-down a 6S LiPo battery (18V
  to 25V) to 3.3V and 5V
* Programmed a python script that captures/loads an audio signal and analyzes 
  its relative power spectral density
* Formulated a control system for noise canceling that was instantiated on
  an FPGA via SystemVerilog

//| Personal]
//:project-duration: August 2018 - Current
include::template/project.adoc[]
* Wrote a typescript electron app with a 3D interface that displays sensors'
  orientations and calculates a continuous, multi-revolution axis-angle
  representation of the sensors' relative rotation.
* Developed a hardware abstraction layer for STM32L4 (Arm Cortex M4)
  C which outperforms vendor's
//* Created a Windows Forms user interface that pairs sensors, shares the 
//  symmetric encryption key, and displays sensors' orientations
