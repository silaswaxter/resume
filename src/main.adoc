:experience-organization-name: METER Group Inc
:experience-duration: June 2022 -- Sept. 2022
:experience-job-title: Firmware Engineering Intern
:experience-job-location: Pullman, Washington
include::template/experience.adoc[]
* Created a hardware-in-the-loop continuous integration system for the AquaLab3
  product
* Wrote a smoke-test for the AquaLab3 HIL CI which exercises the serial firmware 
  update, a subset of the command-line interface, and checks for expected device
  state
* Developed an internal serial-abstraction library for Windows and Unix that 
  supports python v2.7+
* Refactored the AquaLab3 CLI documentation ensuring correctness and applying 
  git styled documentation enabling parsability
