* Infrastructure as code and single source of truth.
** Building infrastructure will reduce the time for bringing on new members of
   a team.
** Make the docker image extensible such that it can be used by multiple
   projects
* Bazel has support for many of the things I was trying to script. Plus more.
* ANVIL sits "between" the device and the host and provides a single source of
  truth software package for the development tools.
